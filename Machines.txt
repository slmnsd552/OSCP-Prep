4. billu box : very interesting.
5. sickos series both 1 and 2
sickos1 -----------------------directories are not accessible directly, we have to go through proxy, looking into robots.txt found a directory cms, by going into that directory we go to admin panel and used default credintial to login , after that uploaded shell and got the root access by sudo su.
6. Fristileak 	----- enemurating got the admin panel, login by decoding source code, uploaded shell, PE--- through notes gone to home directory there was a password file, encrypter was there in that folder, so created decrypter,
						after that sudo using that credintial, gone to credintial directory and run a dcom command which gives a root access. 
7. droopy ----- There was a vulnerable version of dropel which was affected by SQL, Running exploits reset the password, PS:------ kernal exploit was availabele gives the root
8. Milnet  ------ viewing source code gives us RFI, Through rfi got the shell. PE---- through TAR command having * we got root
9. Necromance 
10. Troll 1  ----- there was webserver running but initially nothing was usefull. there is also FTP server running whih is allowing anonymus login, after login got a pcap file, viewing that pcap file gives a directory, going 
					on to the directory gives a executable file ...using strings decoded that executable and got another directory which gives a list of user & password. using hydra we got the login through ssh. PE- overslays
11. Acid Series
Server
Reloaded 
both are awesome. Great for web pentesting
12. Lord of the root.
many ways even BOF way too there. So must do For OSCP Preparation but i highely encourage first do without BOF then learn BOF then again solve this machine after BOF
13. Sokar and Pwnlab machines also superb --------------- port scanning all ports give access to webapp. viewing source code gives shellshock vulnerability which targets enviourimental variables to execute code, through this
														we got the reverse shell. PE- sudo PS1="() { :;} ;  /bin/sh" /home/bynarr/lime Using this shellcode vulnerability got the root accesss.
14. Darknet [ Another favorite machine. Medium one] Highely Recommended from my side
15.DonkyDocker [to learn docker pentesting]. Highely Suggested for OSCP from my side. Why u will understand when you will do OSCP 
16. Mr ROBOT -> Easy to Medium
17. Minotaur - > Medium
18. pipe machine 
19. Zico machine. Great Machine - Easy to medium 	-----> 
20. LazySysAdmin :Must for OSCP Preparation  -----> Enemurating the directories came accross php & wordpress admin pages. On port scanning there was smbshare on port 139 & 445, using smbshare connected and go wordress login,
													through wordpress got the shell P.E--> just done su to gogie, togie was having sudo permission
21. covfefe - Very Easy machine. [If you done all above 20 machine then you can do this machine in 15 minutes]
22. Breach Series [Mine favorite machines too]
Breach 1 and Breach 2 and Breach 3
I did 1 and 2 Complete and 3 half
